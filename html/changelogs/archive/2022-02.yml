      adjacent to it)    '

  - tweak: 'electronics vendors now have 7 low capacity cells (up from 6)  '

      delay from 2.4 seconds to 1.6 seconds, falloff from 4 to 3, range from 14 to
      15, accurate range from 7 to 10 for the M2C. Overheat limit increased from 30
      to 42. Intended to improve M2's reliability  at medium ranges to take advantage
      of its screen bonuses, while improving its existing proficiency at close range.
      As an important addendum to the assemble delay, the 1 second time was a product
      of a previous bugfix and changes to the M56D.
  - tweak: 'The M2C''s overheat threshold has been increased from 30 to 40 shots,
      while the cooldown rate has been increased from 1.5 points per second to 2 points
      per second. This has been intended to improve its staying power as an offensive/counter-offensive
      weapon, which had been greatly strained due to initial balance philosophies
      for the design. '
  - rscadd: M2C can now be rotated and not fired at the same time, middle click in
      a direction that the active gun is not facing. Common complaint from many user
      experiences has been addressed with a patch; also who the hell uses middle click
      to switch hands in 2022?
  - rscadd: 'If back slot is empty, the M2C will automatically be equipped upon disassembly.
      This serves a QOL to reduce failures to equip by a secondary weapon being blocked
      in the back first by muscle memory. '
  - tweak: 'Adds colour to the rotating prompts for the M2C. Nothing remarkable to
      point out. '
